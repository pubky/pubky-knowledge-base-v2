## Layer Breakdown

### Identity Layer

The foundation of Pubky is cryptographic identity based on **[key pairs](/explore/technologies/key-pair/)**.

**Components:**
- **[Pubky Ring](/explore/technologies/pubky-ring/)**: Mobile app for secure key management
- **Key Pairs**: Ed25519 public/private key pairs
- **Recovery Files**: Encrypted backups for key recovery

**How It Works:**
1. User generates a key pair (public + private key)
2. Public key becomes permanent identity (z-base-32 encoded)
3. Private key stays secure on device, used for signing
4. Recovery file enables backup and cross-device usage

**Key Properties:**
- ✅ Self-sovereign (no registration with authorities)
- ✅ Portable across devices
- ✅ Permanent (never changes)
- ✅ Cryptographically secure

---

### Discovery Layer

The discovery layer enables finding Homeservers and resolving identities without central servers.

**Components:**
- **[PKARR](/explore/pubkycore/pkarr/introduction/)**: Public Key Addressable Resource Records
- **[Mainline DHT](/explore/technologies/mainline-dht/)**: Distributed Hash Table (10M+ nodes)
- **[PKDNS](/explore/technologies/pkdns/)**: DNS servers for resolving public-key domains

**How It Works:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Ring as Pubky Ring
    participant DHT as Mainline DHT
    participant PKDNS
    participant HS as Homeserver
    
    User->>Ring: Create Identity
    Ring->>DHT: Publish PKARR Record
    Note over DHT: Record contains homeserver URL
    User->>PKDNS: Resolve public key
    PKDNS->>DHT: Fetch PKARR Record
    DHT->>PKDNS: Return signed record
    PKDNS->>User: Return homeserver URL
    User->>HS: Connect to homeserver
```

**Key Features:**
- Decentralized discovery (no central directory)
- Censorship resistant (15+ years proven infrastructure)
- Self-published (users control their records)
- Updateable (switch Homeservers anytime)

---

### Storage Layer

**[Homeservers](/explore/pubkycore/homeserver/)** store user data in a key-value format over HTTP/HTTPS.

**Architecture:**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User1[User 1] --> HS1[Homeserver A]
    User2[User 2] --> HS1
    User3[User 3] --> HS2[Homeserver B]
    User4[User 4] --> HS3[Homeserver C]
    
    HS1 --> DB1[(PostgreSQL)]
    HS2 --> DB2[(LMDB)]
    HS3 --> DB3[(Files)]
```

**Key Properties:**
- **User Choice**: Pick any Homeserver or run your own
- **Data Ownership**: You control your data
- **Portability**: Switch Homeservers without losing data
- **Persistence Backends**: Files, LMDB, PostgreSQL, or SQL

**API Operations:**
- `PUT /pub/app/path` - Store data
- `GET /pub/app/path` - Retrieve data
- `DELETE /pub/app/path` - Delete data
- `LIST /pub/app/` - List directory

---

### Application Layer

Applications consume data from Homeservers, either directly or through aggregation services.

**Architecture Patterns:**

#### 1. Simple Client-Homeserver

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Client[Client App] <--> HS[Homeserver]
```

**Use Case**: Personal apps, simple tools, direct data access

#### 2. Global Aggregator

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    HS1[Homeserver 1] --> Agg[Aggregator]
    HS2[Homeserver 2] --> Agg
    HS3[Homeserver N] --> Agg
    Agg --> Client[Client App]
```

**Use Case**: Social feeds, search, discovery (e.g., [Pubky Nexus](/explore/pubky-apps/indexing-and-aggregation/pubky-nexus/))

#### 3. Custom Backend

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    HS[Homeservers] --> Agg[Custom Aggregator]
    Agg --> ML[ML Inference]
    Agg --> Search[Search Engine]
    ML --> API[Custom API]
    Search --> API
    API --> Client[Client]
```

**Use Case**: Advanced features, recommendations, specialized processing

## Data Flow Example: Publishing a Post

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Ring as Pubky Ring
    participant App as Pubky App
    participant HS as Homeserver
    participant Nexus
    
    User->>Ring: Authorize App
    Ring->>App: Grant session token
    User->>App: Create post
    App->>HS: PUT /pub/pubky.app/posts/123
    HS->>HS: Verify signature
    HS->>HS: Store post data
    HS->>App: 200 OK
    Nexus->>HS: Poll /events endpoint
    Nexus->>HS: Fetch new post
    Nexus->>Nexus: Index post
    App->>Nexus: GET /v0/stream/posts
    Nexus->>App: Feed with new post
```

See [Authentication](/explore/pubkycore/authentication/) for the full authentication flow.

### Data Integrity

**All data operations are signed:**
1. Client creates data
2. Client signs hash with private key
3. Homeserver verifies signature
4. Data stored with signature
5. Anyone can verify authenticity

### Trust Model

**What you trust:**
- ✅ Mathematics (cryptography)
- ✅ Your own keys
- ⚠️ Your Homeserver for availability (not integrity)

**What you DON'T trust:**
- ❌ Central authorities
- ❌ DNS registrars
- ❌ Server operators to verify data (math does it)

## Scalability Characteristics

### Horizontal Scaling

| Component | Scaling Method |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Homeservers** | Add more servers, users distribute naturally |
| **PKDNS** | Run multiple instances, cache aggressively |
| **Nexus** | Shard by user/data type, read replicas |
| **Mainline DHT** | Already 10M+ nodes, proven at scale |

### Performance Metrics

**Typical Latencies:**
- PKARR lookup (cached): < 100ms
- PKARR lookup (DHT): 500-2000ms
- Homeserver GET: 50-200ms
- Nexus API: 10-50ms (sub-millisecond for cached)
