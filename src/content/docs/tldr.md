title: "Pubky: 30-Second Overview"
---

**Pubky is a decentralized web protocol that puts you in control of your identity and data.**

## What It Is

- **Your Identity = Your Key**: No usernames, no accounts. Your public key is your permanent identity.
- **Your Data, Your Choice**: Store data on any Homeserver you choose. Switch anytime without losing anything.
- **Censorship Resistant**: Built on the Mainline DHT (15+ years proven, 10M+ nodes). No single authority can block you.
- **No Blockchain**: Fast, free operations using standard web technologies (HTTP/HTTPS).

## How It Works

```mermaid

    You[Your Key] --> PKARR[PKARR Record]
    PKARR --> DHT[Mainline DHT]
    PKARR --> HS[Your Homeserver]
    Apps[Apps] --> HS
    Apps --> DHT
```

1. Generate a cryptographic key pair (your identity)
2. Publish a PKARR record to the DHT (points to your Homeserver)
3. Store your data on any Homeserver
4. Apps discover and access your data via your public key

## Why It Matters

**Replace Big Tech**: No algorithm controls your feed. No company owns your data.

**Replace Big State**: Censorship becomes impractical when data lives on millions of distributed nodes.

**Replace Big Banks**: Native integration with Bitcoin/Lightning for true financial freedom (coming soon).
