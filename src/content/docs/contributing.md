## Contributing to Documentation

### Quick Edits

For small fixes (typos, links, formatting):

1. **Fork the repository**: [github.com/pubky/pubky-knowledge-base](https://github.com/pubky/pubky-knowledge-base)
2. **Make your changes**: Edit markdown files directly
3. **Submit a pull request**: Include a clear description

### Larger Contributions

For new pages or significant changes:

1. **Discuss first**: Open an issue to discuss your plans
2. **Follow the structure**: Match existing page organization
3. **Use proper linking**: Use wiki-links `Page Name` for internal links
4. **Add to index**: Update `index.md` if adding new major pages
5. **Test locally**: Build with Quartz to verify

**Build locally:**
```bash
cd pubky-knowledge-base/quartz
npm install
npm run docs
# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

### Documentation Style Guide

**Markdown Conventions:**
- Use `# Title` for page titles (H1, only one per page)
- Use `## Section` for major sections (H2)
- Use `### Subsection` for subsections (H3)
- Use wiki-links for internal references: `Page Name`
- Use standard markdown links for external URLs: `[text](url)`

**Code Blocks:**
```javascript
// Always specify language
const example = "like this";
```

**Linking:**
```markdown
<!-- Internal (wiki-link) -->
[Pubky Core](/explore/pubkycore/introduction/)
[Pubky Core Overview](/explore/pubkycore/introduction/)

<!-- External -->
[Official Docs](https://pubky.github.io/pubky-core/)
```

**Images:**
```markdown
<!-- Always include descriptive alt text -->
