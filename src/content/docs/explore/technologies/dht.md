title: "Distributed Hash Table"
---

It is a decentralized key-value store that allows for efficient data retrieval in a distributed system. Unlike traditional databases, DHTs do not rely on a central server to manage data. Instead, they use a hash function to map keys to nodes in the network, enabling data to be stored and retrieved across multiple nodes.

A relevant example of DHT for Pubky is the [Mainline DHT](/explore/technologies/mainline-dht/) that is used primarily by the BitTorrent Network.

## Key Features

- **Decentralization**: DHTs operate without a central authority, making them highly resilient to failures and [censorship](/explore/concepts/censorship/).

- **Scalability**: They can easily scale to accommodate more data and users by adding more nodes to the network.

- **Efficiency**: By distributing data across multiple nodes, DHTs can provide fast access to data without the need for a central server.

## Applications

DHTs are widely used in various applications, including:

- **P2P Networks**: They are the backbone of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, enabling the sharing of files and resources among users.

- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: DHTs help in efficiently distributing content across a global network of servers, improving load balancing and reducing latency.

## Challenges

Despite their advantages, DHTs face several challenges, including:

- **Security**: Ensuring data privacy and integrity in a decentralized environment.

- **Consistency**: Achieving consistency across the distributed network, especially in the presence of node failures or network partitions.

- **Performance**: Balancing the trade-off between data distribution and access latency.

DHTs represent a significant advancement in distributed systems, offering a scalable and efficient solution for data storage and retrieval in decentralized environments.
