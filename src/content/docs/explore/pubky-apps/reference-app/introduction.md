# Pubky Client

![pubkey-client](/images/pubky-header.png)

The Pubky client is the user-facing application for interacting with the Pubky social network. It is available as a progressive web app (PWA) and will eventually support desktop applications.

## Current Implementation

- **Live Application**: [pubky.app](https://pubky.app) - Production PWA currently operational
- **Backend**: Powered by [Pubky Nexus](/explore/pubky-apps/indexing-and-aggregation/pubky-nexus/) indexing service using Synonym hosted infrastructure
## Development Status

The web client is live at [pubky.app](https://pubky.app).

**For Developers**:
- **Building Compatible Clients**: Use [pubky-app-specs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pubky-app-specs) as the authoritative data model specification
- **Contributing**: Contributions welcome at [github.com/pubky/pubky-app](https://github.com/pubky/pubky-app)

Using the library analogy, the Pubky Client is like a personalized research assistant who takes the prepared documents from the librarian ([backend](/explore/pubky-apps/indexing-and-aggregation/introduction/)) and creates a customized report just for you. This report is designed to be easy to read and understand, with all the relevant information presented in a clear and concise manner.

- Users are able to take control of the data and exit the Synonym hosted services and run their own without hampering discoverability ([credible exit](/explore/concepts/credible-exit/)).

- Pubky client uses the open [Pubky Core](/explore/pubkycore/introduction/) for nearly all features, allowing users to avoid censorship by choosing self-hosting or alternate hosts without losing followers or integrity. 

- Pubky also includes support for **[Paykit](/explore/technologies/paykit/)**, an open payment protocol (work in progress) for coordinating payments among peers supporting various methods. This allows users to potentially create payment flows for familiar experiences.

⚠️ **Note**: Paykit is currently **work in progress** and not production-ready. Integrations in Bitkit (iOS and Android) serve as testbeds for protocol development, not production features. The protocol specification, security model, and implementation are subject to significant changes.

**Planned Paykit Features** (WIP):
- **Pay to profiles**: Send payments to Pubky identities without requesting addresses/invoices
- **Method discovery**: Discover which payment methods someone accepts (onchain, Lightning)
- **Encrypted negotiation**: Private [Pubky Noise](/explore/technologies/pubky-noise/) channels for secure payment coordination
- **Subscriptions**: Cryptographically signed recurring payment agreements
- **Zero custody**: Users always control their keys and funds

Future Pubky app versions may leverage Paykit once it reaches production readiness to enable peer-to-peer data markets, creator monetization, and value exchange throughout the ecosystem.

- Communities facilitate moderation and discovery around shared interests.
